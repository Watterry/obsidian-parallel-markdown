# Obsidian Parallel Markdown Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian editor who's work needs to compare document paragraph by paragraph, image by image, mathematical function to mathematical function. The most similar work is like translation work which needs to put original text on the left side and put tranlated text on the right side.

**Note:** The plugin is under development and backup your data before you test it in your Obisian Vault!

## features

If you are a translator working with two parallel documents, this is the tool for you!

Typical usage scenario:

1. Use a tool to convert pdf to markdown. The pdf is the target you want to translate.

2. Open the markdown file and enable Obsidian Parallel Markdown plugin, then you can edit the translation on the right side and check the original text on the left side. If you scroll one side, the other side will scroll according to paragraph.
